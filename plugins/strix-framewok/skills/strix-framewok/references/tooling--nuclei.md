## Adaptation and execution contract

This reference is technical guidance for the selected test family, not a grant of
scope or a list of commands to run indiscriminately. Follow the skill's scope,
tool-adaptation, evidence, and fix-mode contracts. Historical example hosts, paths,
tool flags and framework/CVE versions must be checked against the actual target
and current primary documentation. Verify installed tool help before using a flag.
Use synthetic data, minimal proof, controlled callbacks and agreed effect limits.
Post-exploitation examples describe possible impact; do not collect real secrets,
establish persistence, claim resources, or expand scope to demonstrate it.

Every applicable technique below becomes a concrete coverage row: prerequisite,
security invariant, legitimate baseline, controlled probe, expected secure result,
counterevidence, captured evidence and outcome. Missing capabilities create a gap;
they do not turn a test into a pass. Tool names inherited from Strix refer to the
replacement operations in [tool adaptation](tool-adaptation.md), not available APIs.
Use [evidence rules](evidence-and-reporting.md) when an older section demands runtime
proof for everything: complete static traces and exact advisory matches are separate
reportable classes with their limitations. Audit is the default; changes require
fix intent. Preserve behavior and retest the boundary, not only one payload.

## Adapted technical playbook

# Nuclei CLI Playbook

Official docs:
- https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/opensource/nuclei/running
- https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/opensource/nuclei/mass-scanning-cli
- https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei

Canonical syntax:
`nuclei [flags]`

High-signal flags:
- `-u, -target <url>` single target
- `-l, -list <file>` targets file
- `-im, -input-mode <mode>` list/burp/jsonl/yaml/openapi/swagger
- `-t, -templates <path|tag>` explicit template path(s)
- `-tags <tag1,tag2>` run by tag
- `-s, -severity <critical,high,...>` severity filter
- `-as, -automatic-scan` tech-mapped automatic scan
- `-ni, -no-interactsh` disable OAST/interactsh requests
- `-rl, -rate-limit <n>` global request rate cap
- `-c, -concurrency <n>` template concurrency
- `-bs, -bulk-size <n>` hosts in parallel per template
- `-timeout <seconds>` request timeout
- `-retries <n>` retries
- `-stats` periodic scan stats output
- `-silent` findings-only output
- `-j, -jsonl` JSONL output
- `-o <file>` output file

Agent-safe baseline for automation:
`nuclei -l targets.txt -as -s critical,high -rl 50 -c 20 -bs 20 -timeout 10 -retries 1 -silent -j -o nuclei.jsonl`

Common patterns:
- Focused severity scan:
  `nuclei -u https://target.tld -s critical,high -silent -o nuclei_high.txt`
- List-driven controlled scan:
  `nuclei -l targets.txt -as -rl 50 -c 20 -bs 20 -timeout 10 -retries 1 -j -o nuclei.jsonl`
- Tag-driven run:
  `nuclei -l targets.txt -tags cve,misconfig -s critical,high,medium -silent`
- Explicit templates:
  `nuclei -l targets.txt -t http/cves/ -t dns/ -rl 30 -c 10 -bs 10 -j -o nuclei_templates.jsonl`
- Deterministic non-OAST run:
  `nuclei -l targets.txt -as -s critical,high -ni -stats -rl 30 -c 10 -bs 10 -timeout 10 -retries 1 -j -o nuclei_no_oast.jsonl`

Critical correctness rules:
- Provide a template selection method (`-as`, `-t`, or `-tags`); avoid unscoped broad runs.
- Keep `-rl`, `-c`, and `-bs` explicit for predictable resource use.
- Use `-ni` when outbound interactsh/OAST traffic is not expected or not allowed.
- Use structured output (`-j -o <file>`) for automation.

Usage rules:
- Start with severity/tags/templates filters to keep runs explainable.
- Keep retries conservative (`-retries 1`) unless transport instability is proven.
- Do not use `-h`/`--help` for routine operation unless absolutely necessary.

Failure recovery:
- If performance degrades, lower `-c/-bs` before lowering `-rl`.
- If findings are unexpectedly empty, verify template selection (`-as` vs explicit `-t/-tags`).
- If scan duration grows, reduce target set and enforce stricter template/severity filters.
