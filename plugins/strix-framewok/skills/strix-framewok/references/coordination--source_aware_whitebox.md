## Adaptation and execution contract

This reference is technical guidance for the selected test family, not a grant of
scope or a list of commands to run indiscriminately. Follow the skill's scope,
tool-adaptation, evidence, and fix-mode contracts. Historical example hosts, paths,
tool flags and framework/CVE versions must be checked against the actual target
and current primary documentation. Verify installed tool help before using a flag.
Use synthetic data, minimal proof, controlled callbacks and agreed effect limits.
Post-exploitation examples describe possible impact; do not collect real secrets,
establish persistence, claim resources, or expand scope to demonstrate it.

Every applicable technique below becomes a concrete coverage row: prerequisite,
security invariant, legitimate baseline, controlled probe, expected secure result,
counterevidence, captured evidence and outcome. Missing capabilities create a gap;
they do not turn a test into a pass. Tool names inherited from Strix refer to the
replacement operations in [tool adaptation](tool-adaptation.md), not available APIs.
Use [evidence rules](evidence-and-reporting.md) when an older section demands runtime
proof for everything: complete static traces and exact advisory matches are separate
reportable classes with their limitations. Audit is the default; changes require
fix intent. Preserve behavior and retest the boundary, not only one payload.

## Adapted technical playbook

# Source-Aware White-Box Coordination

Use this coordination playbook when repository source code is available.

## Objective

Increase white-box coverage by combining source-aware triage with dynamic validation. Source-aware tooling is expected by default when source is available.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Build a quick source map before deep exploitation, including at least one AST-structural pass (`sg` or `tree-sitter`) scoped to relevant paths.
   - For `sg` baseline, derive `sg-targets.txt` from `semgrep.json` scope first (`paths.scanned`, fallback to unique `results[].path`) and run `xargs ... sg run` on that list.
   - Only fall back to path heuristics when semgrep scope is unavailable.
2. Run first-pass static triage to rank high-risk paths.
3. Use triage outputs to prioritize dynamic PoC validation.
4. Keep findings evidence-driven: no report without validation.

## Source-Aware Triage Stack

- `semgrep`: fast security-first triage and custom pattern scans
- `ast-grep` (`sg`): structural pattern hunting and targeted repo mapping
- `tree-sitter`: syntax-aware parsing support for symbol and route extraction
- `gitleaks` + `trufflehog`: complementary secret detection (working tree and history coverage)
- `trivy fs`: dependency, misconfiguration, license, and secret checks

Coverage target per repository:
- one `semgrep` pass
- one AST structural pass (`sg` and/or `tree-sitter`)
- one secrets pass (`gitleaks` and/or `trufflehog`)
- one `trivy fs` pass

## Agent Delegation Guidance

- Keep child agents specialized by vulnerability/component as usual.
- For source-heavy subtasks, prefer creating child agents with `source_aware_sast` skill.
- Use source findings to shape payloads and endpoint selection for dynamic testing.

## Validation Guardrails

- Static findings are hypotheses until validated.
- Dynamic exploitation evidence is still required before vulnerability reporting.
- Keep scanner output concise, deduplicated, and mapped to concrete code locations.
